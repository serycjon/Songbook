# Songbook
This is a personal songbook created with Latex and the Song Latex package.

Documentation is found [here](http://songs.sourceforge.net/songsdoc/songs.html).

## Useful
Created a git shell alias in the .bashrc file with 
`alias pdfsong='pdflatex "C:\Dev\Songbook\songbook.tex" && 
"C:\Program Files (x86)\Google\Chrome\Application\chrome.exe" "C:\Dev\Songbook\songbook.pdf"'`. Compiles the .tex into .pdf and opens it in the browser.
